# Movies IaC - AWS

This is a web application that provides users an interactive interface to explore different movies. This is meant to be hosted on AWS using IaC to set up infrastructure.

## Description

* Using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), fully functional architecture is set up and deployed to the AWS cloud. A diagram visualizing the infrastructure can be viewed [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/7e626867-cf57-4718-a4c2-d2fc88451765/edit?viewport_loc=-275%2C60%2C2219%2C1065%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_d136f3dc-0d9e-4589-8a91-ad80b4a5fb22)
* Running on this infrastructure is a node.js web application that displays movies and information about them. 
* AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy is used to manage version control.
